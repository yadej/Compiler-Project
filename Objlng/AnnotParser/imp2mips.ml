   Simple translation from IMP to MIPS.

   Summary of MIPS architecture and assembly language.


   32-bits architecture comprising:
   - an arithmetic and logical unit
   - 32 registers
     * general purpose: $t0-$t9, $s0-$s7, $a0-$a3, $v0-$v1
     * special purpose: $ra, $sp, $fp, $gp, $zero
     (+3 reserved)
   - randomly addressable memory, containing code and data


   A MIPS program contains two parts :
   - instructions, introduced by the directive

       .text

   - data, introduced by the directive

       .data

   The data part contains statically allocated data, for instance the
   global variables of a program. Each piece of data is given a label
   that will be used for accessing the data.



   *** Arithmetic ***

   Arithmetic instructions in "three addresses" format, that apply to 
   values stored in registers, and also put the result in a register.
   Three addresses format:

     add  $r1, $r2, $r3

   means  $r1 <- $r2 + $r3 
   where $r1 is the register where the result is to be stored, and $r2 and
   $r3 are the registers containing the value to be summed.
   
   Many instructions in this format: 
   - arithmetic: add, sub, mul, div, rem, sll, srl
   - logic: and, or
   - comparisons: seq, sne, slt, sle, sgt, sge
   Some unary operations ask for only one operand:
   - not, neg, move

   A few arithmetic instructions take a number as second operand.
   For instance:

     addi  $r1, $r2, i

   for  $r1 <- $r2 + i


   Loading a value in a register:

     li  $r, i

   for  $r <- i


   *** Memory ***

   A memory address is identified by a base address contained in a
   register [$r], and an offset [o] relative to the base address. The
   offset is given directly as a number.
   Notation: o($r).
   Addresses are given in bytes. A 32-bits piece of data occupies 4 bytes.

   Read access

     lw  $r1, o($r2)

   for  $r1 <- *($r2+o)
   which means "$r1 takes the value stored at address $r2+o".

   Write access

     sw  $r1, o($r2)

   for  *($r2+o) <- $r1
   which means "store at address $r2+o the value of register $r1".


   Statically allocated data are, as everything else, stored in memory. 
   Retrieve the address associated to a label [lab] of statically allocated
   data with
   
     la  $r1, lab


   *** Branching instructions ***

   The running program is stored in memory: each instruction has an address.
   Special register [pc] contains the address of the next instruction.

   In most cases, execution of a given instruction is followed by the execution
   of its immediate successor in memory, which corresponds to
     pc <- pc + 4
   Jump or branch instructions drive execution towards other parts of the
   program, identified by one the following means:
   - a label written at some place in the assembly program,
   - an address that has been computed and stored in a register.

   Unconditional jumps with target given by a label 
   (two versions are subtly different, but we will ignore the difference).
     
     j  lab
     b  lab

   Unconditional jump with target address given by a register 

     jr  $r

   Two variants used for function calls, which store the value [pc+4] in the
   special purpose register $ra. This stored address identifies the instruction
   where execution should resume once the call is completed.

     jal   lab
     jalr  $r


   Conditional jumps to a label, depending on the result of a test.
   Example: jumps to the instruction with label [lab] si the values in 
   registers $r1 and $r2 are equal.

     beq  $r1, $r2, lab

   Available binary tests:
   - beq, bne, bgt, bge, blt, ble

   Particular cases with only one operand, equivalant to the previous 
   instructions with $r2=0

     beqz  $r1, lab

   Available tests-to-zero:
   - beqz, bnez, bgtz, bgez, bltz, blez


   *** System calls ***

   For this course we do not use actual MIPS hardware but a simulator.
   This simulator includes a few special operations that mimick some services
   that would otherwise be offered by the operating system, or a low-level
   library like the libc. These operations are triggered by the additional
   instruction
     
     syscall

   which is not part of the actual assembly language.
   Each service has a numeric code, that has to be put in register $v0.
   If an argument is needed, it is put in register $a0.

   Some services:
   - code 1: prints the integer contained in register $a0
   - code 10: halts the program
   - code 11: prints the character whose ASCII code is given by $a0

       frame of the caller. This implicitly creates a linked list of the
       activation frames of all the currently active calls, that starts
       with the most recent.
     - At address $fp-4, we store the return address of the call, that is
       the address in the code of the caller at which the execution will 
       resume after the call. This is the address that is put in $ra when
       the call is performed. It is stored in the activation frame so as
       not to be destroyed by the next call.
